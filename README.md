Tumblr
======
Carousel
============

Time spent: Approx. 7 (spending the rest on group project) 

Optional: Photo tiles move with scrolling

Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
Compose button should modally present the compose screen.


Notes:
When I set each of the tabs to be individual buttons, the transparency shows through on the compose page and I see the last screen.
When I put all the tabs into one button, it doesn't. Is it because switches instead of layering?
